## Objectives

Here are the steps on **how to deploy** the web application on your machine. We've used docker to package all the components. Please install docker if not already.

- First of all clone the git repo : `git clone https://github.com/Naguir/Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-2019-Project-Two.git`
- Then move to the directory you cloned and again to **topology**
- Make sure your docker is running and type `docker-compose up --build`
- Navigate to `192.168.99.100/userapi` or `192.168.99.100/api` as you have to use docker-machine. Sorry hadn't time to make available for Docker Windows/Mac.
- The pages should appear. Few accounts are already set up.
